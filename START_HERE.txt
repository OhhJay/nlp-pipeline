🎯 THE SCENARIO:
----------------
You're analyzing student feedback from 3 online courses:
- Introduction to Python
- Data Science Fundamentals  
- Web Development

Goal: Use NLP to find which courses need improvement!

🚀 QUICK START (3 STEPS):
-------------------------

Step 1: Look at the raw data
----------------------------
head -n 10 student_feedback.csv

You'll see student feedback like:
- "This course was absolutely fantastic!"

- "Great course! Loved the hands-on projects."

Step 2: Run sentiment analysis
------------------------------
cd ..
python run_pipeline.py \
  --source-type csv \
  --source real_world_example/student_feedback.csv \
  --text-column feedback \
  --output real_world_example/analyzed_feedback.csv

This analyzes all 50 reviews in seconds!

Step 3: Explore the results
---------------------------
cd real_world_example
python exercises.py

Follow the interactive exercises to discover insights!
